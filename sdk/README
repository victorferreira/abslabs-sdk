# SDK Library README

## Overview
This SDK library provides easy-to-use functions to interact with our service, including distributing rewards and retrieving points. 

## Installation
You can install the SDK library via NPM:

```bash
npm install your-sdk-library-name

## Public Functions

### 1. `distribute`
Distributes points to users.

**Parameters:**
- `eventName`: The event name allows the client to group issed points for the same event
- `poinstData`: An object containing the `address` and the amount of `points` to be issued.

**Example:**
```typescript
const result = await sdk.distribute(
    eventName: "mkt_campaing",
    pointsData: { 
        address: '0xfedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98', 
        points: 50 
    }
);

console.log(result);
```

### 2. `getPoints`
Retrieves the issued points for a given address.

**Example:**
```javascript
const address = "0xfedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98"
const result = await sdk.getPoints(address);

console.log(result);
```

### 3. `getPointsByAddressAndEvent`
Retrieves points for a specific user address and event.

**Parameters:**
- `address` (String): The userâ€™s address.

```typescript
const address = "0xfedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98";
